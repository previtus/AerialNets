# AerialNets
Set of small projects revolving around aerial imagery data (satellite images). Can be considered as a set of side projects and brain storm space for the [Change Detection project](https://github.com/previtus/ChangeDetectionProject).

## Case 1: semantic segmentation and digital surface model prediction using the Topcoder Urban Mapper 3D dataset

Dataset: [Topcoder Urban Mapper 3D](https://community.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewProblemStatement&rd=17007&compid=57607)

Notes:

- good source for DSM

- not many cathegorical labels for semantic segmentation (seems like it has only two classes "building" and "non-building")

- decent amount of data, can be tiled into 11136 images of (256, 256, 3) resolution
